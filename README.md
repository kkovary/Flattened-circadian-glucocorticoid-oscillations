# Flattened-circadian-glucocorticoid-oscillations

### About
This web app is designed to explore specific comparative RNA-seq analysis for the manuscript "Flattened circadian glucocorticoid oscillations cause obesity due to increased lipid turnover and lipid uptake". At the moment two comparative datasets can be explored:
* WAT tissue - cort pellet vs sham pellet
* BAT tissue - cort pellet vs sham pellet
